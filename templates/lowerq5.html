  <h3>Confused on what career pathway you want to pursue?</h3>
   <p>High school students can often have trouble deciding what career to choose.
     Most people need some preparation before they‚Äôre ready for the workforce, and planning should begin long before it‚Äôs time to start a career.
     This could include taking technical courses during high school or, after graduating, attending a college or university to earn a certificate or a degree.
     Knowing what type of career preparation you need begins with thinking about what type of career you want.</p>
