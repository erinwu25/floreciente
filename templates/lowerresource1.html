  <br><li>#2: Schedule Your Studying in Smaller Increments Over a Long Period of Time: By sticking to a schedule of studying for a reasonable amount of time over the entire semester or term, you'll be able to better store and recall the information you need, and thereby reduce some of the stress that comes from schoolwork, tests, and studying. </li>
  <br><li>#3: Stick to the Same Study Spaces: A stable environment for a particular activity can help put you in the right mood and mind frame to complete the task at hand. The same applies for engaging in studying.</li>
