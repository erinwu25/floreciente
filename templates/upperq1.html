  College Application Tips
    <p>While the application process may seem a little overwhelming, you can use the following information to get ready and figure out your next steps.</p>
  <h3>What deadlines are important?</h3>
    <h4>Early Application Deadline</h4>
    <p>Every university and college has its own application deadlines, but they fall around the same time. Early applicants (early action, early decision or single choice early action) generally need to get their applications in by either November 1 or November 15.</p>
    <h4>Regular Application Deadline</h4>
    <p>The deadline for regular decision applications is normally between January 1 and February 1, depending on the college. Get the bulk of your essays done and confirm who will write your recommendations in November, so you wonâ€™t have a lot of last-minute work to do during the holiday season.</p>
  <h3>What college application do I use?</h2>
  <p>Students can visit a college's website to determine which applications are accepted.
